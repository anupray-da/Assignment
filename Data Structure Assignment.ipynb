What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python.\n"," - Lists are mutable which means we can modify them after it got created.\n"," - It makes them more flexible but it takes more space and much slower than tuples.\n"," - Syntax for list is '[]'\n"," - Tuples are immutable which means we can not modify it after it's creation. Which prevent any accidental modification and make the code more reliable.\n"," -These are generally faster than lists.\n"," - Syntax for tuple is '()'\n","\n","4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n"," - Dictionaries are unordered collection which means elements are not stored in a specific order.\n"," - It store values in key and value pair which means each key acts as a unique identifier for associated value.\n"," - It takes very less time to retrive the data.\n"," - Ex. dictnr = {1:'a',2:'b'}\n","\n","5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n"," - Set helps to store data and remove the duplicates automatically but list does not remove duplicates.\n"," - Sets are useful for checking membership or finding the intersection/difference between sets.\n","\n","6.  What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n"," - String is a sequence of characters, such as letters, numbers etc.\n"," - Strings are always placed inside single quote or double quotes whereas lists are enclosed in square brackets.\n"," - Strings are immutable while list is mutable.\n","\n","7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","  - Tuples are immutable which means we can not change them after it got created.\n","  - Here you cant add or remove anything from tuple.\n","  - It prevents ay accidental changes and make the code more reliable.\n","\n","8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n"," - A hash table is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value.\n"," - Dictionaries in Python are implemented using hash tables. Which makes them so efficient for storing and retrieving data.\n"," - Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs like hash table.\n","\n","9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n"," - Yes, in Python lists can contain different type of data types.\n"," - We can store int, float,strings and others which make lists more flexible.\n","\n","10.  Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n"," - In Python, strings are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after they are created.\n"," - Here we can not able to add, delete or modify the strings.\n"," - It prevents any accidental update which makes them good to use in code.\n"," - For this it is more efficient and takes less storage.\n","\n","11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n"," - Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, while lists store data as an ordered sequence.\n"," - In dictionary we can fetch the values by using key, which makes them more faster for retriving data.\n"," - Dictionary keys are unique which makes it more useful for avoiding duplicates and maintaining data integrity.\n","\n","12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n"," - Tuples are immutable whereas list is mutable.\n"," - Suppose we are storing emloyee id details where the data should not be changed after it got created, there we need to use tuple.\n"," - Also it prevents any accidental modification to the existing data.\n"," - This ensures the data intigrity and align with the purpose of data storing.\n","\n","13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n"," - In Python sets are designed to store only unique values.\n"," - They automatically delete the duplicate data from the sets.\n"," - Also if you will add any duplicates it will ignore your input and the set will be unchanged.\n"," - Set uses hash table to store the data, if two elements is having same hash code it will ignore one of them.\n","\n","14.  How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n"," - 'in' keyword is generally used to find the membership.\n"," - It checks if a given value is present inside a list or dictionary.\n"," - In list we check if the value is present or not.\n"," - But in dictionary we check if the key is there or not.\n","\n","15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n"," - No, you can not modify the elements of a tuple.\n"," - In Python, it is designed to be immutable which means we can not add, remove or make any kind of changes to the tuple after it got created.\n"," - Tuples are used where the data is fixed and should not be changed. Which makes it more efficient and take less storage.\n","\n","16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","- A nested dictionary is a dictionary where values of the dictionary itself is a dictionary.\n","- It is basically dictionary inside a dictionary. which used to store multi layered data.\n","- Ex. When a company storing their employee details\n","- employee_records = {\n","    'E001': {'name': 'John Doe', 'department': 'Engineering', 'salary': 75000},\n","    'E002': {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'department': 'Marketing', 'salary': 65000},\n","    'E003': {'name': 'David Lee', 'department': 'Finance', 'salary': 80000}\n","}\n","\n","17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n"," - In Python, dictionary store data using hast table.\n"," - Which make them more efficient and give result super fast.\n"," - When we pass the key of dictionary we can get the corresponding values associated to it.\n"," - On average, accessing an element in a dictionary has a time complexity of\n"," O(1)\n","18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries.\n"," - When the order of elements are required in that case we use lists over dictionaries.\n"," - List also can store duplicate values, so when duplicate value is necessary in that place we use lists.\n"," - Also lists are very straightforward, when values don't need any specific organization in that time we can use lists.\n"," - When you need to iterate through elements in a specific order, lists are generally more convenient than dictionaries.\n","\n","19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n"," - Dictionaries are considered unordered collection of data, which means they don't have any specific order for storing the data.\n"," - You cannot access elements in a dictionary using numerical indices like you can with lists. Here you need to use the keys to retrieve the corresponding values to it.\n"," - When we need to iterate over dictionary, the output order may not be same to the order they were added.\n","\n","20.  Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n"," - Lists store values in a sequential order, so we can use the index of value to retrive the data.\n"," - In other hand dictionary store data in key and value pair, so we need to pass the keys to retrive its corresponding values.\n",""],"metadata":{"id":"puKp2VOjorkm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"u9GSmTvFRRqa"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1)Write a code to create a
